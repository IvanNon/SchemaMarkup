"reviewBody":"This house is in a huge complex which I was not expecting.  Would have been better if this was disclosed.   The complex was oceanfront, the house was not.  The view was virtually non existent (if you hang out over the balcony there is a peak-a boo over the air conditioner next door) and I felt I had been mislead, although it was about 10 houses from the beach.  You definitely need golf carts to get around the complex which were fun, but be aware they are an extra charge.  Also linen is an extra charge if you need it, we didn't know about either of these upcharges until after we had booked.  The linen was of poor quality, and the pillows in all rooms need to be replaced.  The house itself has lots of sleeping areas, but if it was full the living area would be cramped.  I wouldn't recommend for more than 8 personally. The furniture in the main living area was very tired and needed a good clean.  Also the kitchen was not very well equipped.  We had to buy basics like a cutting board, wooden spoon and decent knife to use.  There weren't enough plates,cups,spoons for a everyone. Perhaps we were the exception but we tend to cook and eat in.  The complex has a big pool area and recreation centre which the kids loved, it was like being in a campground rather than a beachhouse.  It was probably good value for what we paid, but I would have happily paid more for an ocean view and a little more.  I was probably not a good match for this property.  I will say the owner was very responsive, and to be fair I did not raise any of these issues with her during our stay, we tried just to make the best of it.  I hope this feedback helps a bit of a revamp in a few areas.",

"reviewBody":" My family of 8 and I thoroughly enjoyed our week in this beach house. The rooms were great size clean spacious. The beach was steps away and having the golf cart was so much fun and helpful! The kids loved the amenities especially the new water park and lazy river. The park offers dis counted tickets to local  attractions. The home and grounds were as advertised. Pam was very helpful with any requests we had. I recommend this home to anyone looking for a perfect week in Myrtle Beach",

The kids had lots of fun walking to the beach as well as riding on the golf cart around the campground. The campground is very family-friendly and this was a  much-needed fun time for us all!

"reviewBody":"The house was beautiful and decorated nicely. We were disappointed that it was so far from the ocean 10 houses) and it did not have much of an ocean view.  It is located in a very busy campground.  The beautiful picture of the ocean is not from this house, or even the campground and was very misleading. The owner was very gracious and nice to work with.",

"reviewBody":"This house was off the beach a short walk.  We had 11 people with us and we had plenty of room in the house.  The bathrooms and kitchen could use some updating, but overall a great place.  Would definitely recommend renting a golf cart for your stay, lots of fun stuff to see on the camp grounds.",

"reviewBody":"This house was very comfortable and a perfect fit for my family of 10. The kids especially loved the bunk bed room with its unique set up. The house was very clean and only steps to the beach. We saw many reviews that recommended renting a golf cart so we did and thoroughly enjoyed it. I would highly recommend getting one. The kids enjoyed the nightly golf cart rides and us parents liked being able to take some people to the beach and others to the pool area. Lots to do here! I've never stayed in an area that had so many amenities right on site. We will definitely be back!",
